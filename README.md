# Tic-Tac-Toe-Q-learning


## Description
The Tic Tac Toe Game Simulation and Q-Learning project involved exploring and applying reinforcement learning algorithms to the game of Tic Tac Toe (TTT). The primary focus was on training game-playing agents using the Q-learning algorithm.

A Python program was developed, incorporating essential functions for game state evaluation, move generation, and simulation between random players. This allowed for the creation of a simulated environment to train and evaluate the agents.

The agents were incrementally trained using game state features and labels derived from state data. Features such as board configuration and current player information were used to evaluate the state, while labels represented the optimal action to take. These features and labels were fitted to the agent during the training process.

By applying the Q-learning algorithm and training the agents using the state data, the goal was to create an intelligent Tic Tac Toe player capable of making strategic moves and maximizing its chances of winning.
